# Java REST API Project

This project was created as part of the **Java Development** course at **K.A.T.A. Academy**. It demonstrates the fundamental skills and concepts I acquired during the course, including **Spring Framework**, **Hibernate**, **REST API** development, and database integration using **SQL**.

### Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to create a functional **RESTful API** backend with **Spring** and integrate it with a relational database using **Hibernate ORM**. The project emphasizes the core concepts of backend development and data management.

### Key Features:
- **Spring Framework**: Utilized to build the REST API and manage application context and dependency injection.
- **Hibernate ORM**: Implemented for mapping Java objects to database tables and performing CRUD operations.
- **SQL Database**: The backend interacts with an SQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- **RESTful Services**: Designed to handle HTTP requests and provide data in JSON format.
- **Version Control**: Managed with **Git** for source code versioning and collaboration.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: Core Java concepts including object-oriented programming (OOP).
- **Spring**: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA.
- **Hibernate**: ORM framework for database interaction.
- **SQL**: Database design and queries using relational databases.
- **Git**: Version control using Git for tracking changes.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.

### Project Structure:
- **Controllers**: Handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **Models**: Java classes representing the data and database entities.
- **Repositories**: Interfaces for database operations using Spring Data JPA.
- **Services**: Business logic layer, interacting with the repositories and controllers.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlenaYashkina/kata_3.1.5.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd kata_3.1.5
   ```
3. Build the project using **Maven**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   
Now you can access the API via `http://localhost:8080`.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Building and configuring a Spring-based web application.
- Implementing **REST APIs** and handling JSON data.
- Interacting with a database using **Hibernate** and **JPA**.
- Managing application dependencies with **Maven**.
- Using **Git** for version control and project collaboration.

This project served as a foundational exercise in Java backend development, and it helped me strengthen my understanding of web development, database management, and API design.
